                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>I architected and built a cloud database management application for a shipping logistics business clearing mid-six figure annual revenue to handle 500 monthly shipments across 7 domains.</p>
                
                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
                <p>&#8226; Boosted employee productivity 60% by introducing a customer portal to enable online shipment filing and status checks.</p>
                <p>&#8226; Reduced onboarding from 40+ to 2 hours by prioritizing intentional design and removing over 40 functions that went unused in the legacy software.</p>
                <p>&#8226; Fueled business growth by identifying strong and weak customer relationships via customer retention, invoice size, and frequency analytics.</p>
                
                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                <p>In early December of 2019, I was contacted by a friend whose parent owned and operated a local freight forwarding business. Their parent's company had been using archaic software for over a decade and it was starting to have its effect.</p>
                <p>Problems with the software were beginning to add up. First, the software was badly designed. The company sunk many hours into employee onboarding for the software, and even then, basic tasks such as adding and editing shipments took longer than they should. Second, as the company's customer base grew, they were finding that they could not adequately scale. Since their database software was hosted locally, any customer who wanted to file a shipment, check on the status of their shipments, or edit any information had to call the company directly, resulting in many employees whose sole task was to field phone calls. These two problems had already cost the company tens of thousands of dollars in lost productivity, which is why they decided to hire me.</p>
                <p>I was able to solve each of these problems. As demonstrated in the gif above, I designed intuitive software using React.js that employees could quickly pick up and use. The software supported all the basic operations the company needed, such as adding, deleting, editing, and searching through shipments, in addition to other features.</p>
                <p>Given the fact that I was building the application in the web, using tools such as MongoDB, Amazon Web Services, and Node.js, it was easy to design a customer portal that exposed only a single customer's data to them based on identifying info such as a shipment ID. From this portal, customers could easily check on their shipments. If a human was required, customers could send a message to an employee directly through the software.</p>
                <p>The final product also included extras such as user management to restrict employee access based on inputs such as time of day, an employee's IP address, or job title. And, I was able to write a script to migrate all their old data into the new servers, while also flagging data that was incomplete for manual review.</p>

                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>I significantly improved a suite of image processing tools created to help materials science researchers perform analysis on relevant images.</p>

                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
                <p>&#8226; Led expansion of image upload and preprocessing flow to include custom image editing tools and metadata collection for materials science image analysis applications.</p>
                <p>&#8226; Migrated image analysis alerts from email to real time by integrating Socket.io into REST APIs and security infrastructure.</p>
                <p>&#8226; Conceived and led a web design workshop to teach PhD students how to build personal websites using GitHub Pages and Markdown.</p>
                
                <h2 class='single_experience_subtitle'>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                <p>This past summer, I worked with a research lab to significantly improve their suite of image processing tools. The tools were missing crucial functionality, which downgraded the quality of the analysis researchers could perform on submitted images. Over 10 weeks, I transformed much of the existing infrastructure.</p>
                <p>First, I worked to overhaul the user experience. In addition to a visual redesign of the image upload page, I added much needed frontend tools to gather metadata and edit images before sending them in for analysis. First, I added an image cropping tool to help users crop out unwanted portions of images. Second, I added a scale bar calibration tool that allowed users to highlight the scale bars that were present in the images (many images were taken by microscopes and such) to extrapolate the full dimensions of the images. Finally, I added a tool to help users invert images for certain use cases.</p>
                <p>After completing the frontend work, the next big push was to enable real time responses from the server with the finished image analyses. Since many of the image analysis options took a long time to complete, the lab had opted to send emails to users with a link to the analyzed image. But, the lab wanted the option of real time responses on the same page for image analyses that completed quickly. Thus, I integrated Socket.io into the existing RESTful APIs and security architecture to solve this problem, and programmed a failsafe that triggered an email response in case the Socket.io connection was not able to be maintained.</p>
                <p>Finally, throughout my internship, I worked to improve the quality of the code base that I worked with. Even though I wrote thousands of lines of code, I actually reduced the total amount of code on the website. I did this by being vigilant about deleting redudant code and implementing modular, reusable components whenever possible. In this way, hopefully whoever comes across the code next will have an easier time understanding and working with it.</p>
